### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pedro QueirÃ³s, and this is my GitHub profile.
I'm a PhD student in the University of Luxembourg mostly on the development of bioinformatics tools.

I've worked/currently working on a few tools and smaller repos:

- [Mantis](https://github.com/PedroMTQ/mantis) is a consensus-driven protein function annotation tool
- [UniFunc](https://github.com/PedroMTQ/unifunc) is a functional similarity analysis tool
- [DRAX](https://github.com/PedroMTQ/drax) is a network annotation tool
- [Reference database generator](https://github.com/PedroMTQ/refdb_generator) is a repo that contains code for generating function annotation reference databases
- [Database mappers](https://github.com/PedroMTQ/db_mappers) contains tools for mapping of some highly specific ID types


While I worked on a few different projects, my work is centered around data integration and how we can complementarily use already available data to generate knowledge. Therefore, I'm mostly interested in data engineering, e.g., I implement a lot of ETL workflows for dealing with big data, integrating of data from different sources, efficient data storage, etc.

My general motto is to make good use of good data.
